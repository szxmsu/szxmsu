## Who Am I?

Hey, it's me, Lyon Hu, or as you might know me online, Knowing. Feel free to call me Lyon, or Kitty if you want something cuter. I'm a big fan of Hello Kitty and Cardcaptor Sakura. Adorable things and heart-warming things make my day. People sometimes ask me why I'm so obsessed with Hello Kitty. You guys wanna take a guess? *`*٩(๑>◡<๑)۶*`*.

In life, I'm a photographer, a learner, and an experiencer. I've snowboarded down Mt. Niseko-Annupuri in a snowstorm with low visibility. I've never been to college, and I've not been a maven yet. So, to achieve my aspirations from the bottom of my heart, I've been diligently learning since the beginning of my career. I like life, aspire to be a happy, loving person, and positively influence others in that way.

At work, I'm a software engineer with seven years of professional experience. I'm adept at managing technology and implementing products from scratch. I focus on R&D, designing, and producing, and I embrace [the culture of freedom and responsibility](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077Y4WVPT). I've worked as a front-end engineer at [UCloud](https://www.ucloud.cn/) and a senior software engineer at [Kyligence](https://kyligence.io/). I like work, aspire to be a [digital nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad), and do things that make the world a better place.

I like the movie [The Secret Life of Walter Mitty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/). Walter Mitty's exploration of the unknown is something I admire, and Sean O'Connell's attitude to photography is something I envy. However, what struck me the most was the quote, "To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life." from Life magazine. After I had looked up [Life magazine on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_%28magazine%29), I realized that the quote was originally from the founder, Henry Luce. It perfectly aligns with my life motto, "Read more, walk more." So, I've decided to include it in my profile and share it with you guys.

> To see life; to see the world; to eyewitness great events; to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud; to see strange things — machines, armies, multitudes, shadows in the jungle and on the moon; to see man's work — his paintings, towers and discoveries; to see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within rooms, things dangerous to come to; the women that men love and many children; to see and take pleasure in seeing; to see and be amazed; to see and be instructed ... — Henry Luce

## How Can You Get in Touch with Me?

### WeChat: szxmsu

WeChat is my usual communication tool, and I'll take a look when I'm free. I'll read every message and usually respond within 12 hours, or within 24 hours if I'm busy.

### E-mail: szxmsu@gmail.com

E-mail is my reliable communication tool, and I'll take a look when I'm free. I'll read every e-mail and usually respond within 24 hours, or within 48 hours if I'm busy.

### In Case of Emergency

Since e-mail and WeChat are my asynchronous communication tools, I might not be able to respond immediately. My cell phone is always on silent unless you call or text me. If you have an emergency, feel free to call or text me, and I'll respond as soon as possible. Since phone calls and texts might interrupt me, I trust you could make your own judgment on whether there is an emergency.

I'm not gonna share my phone number here, if you have an emergency in the future, there are other ways to get in touch with me for my phone number.
